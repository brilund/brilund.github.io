This branch will be used to tweak and modify my site to my preferences without breaking what already exists
and works under the master branch. Once I am satisfied with the result, then I can merge this branch with the master branch.

ALWAYS CREATE A SEPEARTE BRANCH WHEN MAKING MAJOR REVISIONS TO YOUR SITE SO AS NOT TO BREAK THE MASTER BRANCH!!!
